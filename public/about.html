<h1>About Me </h1>
<p> Hello I am Avi gupta and I am 19years old. I have completed my 10th from Podar International School (ICSE)
    with an aggregate of 94%. Further my 12th was completed from Ramsheth Thakur Public School with an aggregate of 85%.
    Now I am currently in B.Tech second year at Symbiosis Institute of Technology,Pune pursuing computer science engineering.
</p>

<p>Currently my home is in Navi Mumbai which is just a scenic drive of 1hr30min from the city where my B.Tech college is situated, hence 
  for a student like me weekend's are always somewhat of exciting due to me having a change of going home and seeing my parents.
  Right now in my life I am at a position where I am trying each and every possible domain of computer engineering to figure in which type of company 
  I would like to get placed in when I graduate although doing this has somewhat cause me to have a disbalance for doing things which gave me happiness by doing 
  activites such as going to gym,playing football ,practicing guitar and many more. But eventualy I believe that what so ever I am doing currently is gonna yield
  fruitful results in my future and will alywas be helpful to me. 
</p>

<p> I believe for now this much info is good enough to know what kind of person I am. </p>
